# ED_001
ED_001 is a vst3/au host Max for Live device that allows for more intuitive control over audio plugin parameters, letting the user set two “states” of the plugin to slide between. This not only creates an easier method for automating multiple parameters, giving you continuous control over all of a plugin’s parameters and states; but also doubles as a sound design tool for mixing presets or experimentation. ED-001 also has four mappable dials, giving independent control over specific parameters.




Features:
-Full control over au/vst plugins no matter the number of parameters

-Quick, efficient and very easy to use

-Built-in plugin browser

-Customisable workflow allowing users to create their own method of interacting with audio plugins

-Fully automatable from Ableton

-Adjustable output limiter (w/ lookahead) for safe use with any (loud) plugins

-Smooth interpolation between states


ED_001 IS MADE IN COLLABORATION WITH MARIO SANCHEZ AS PART OF ELASTIC DUMMY.  

ED_001 IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND IS IN A FUNCTIONAL BUT EARLY STATE.
